# Indoor-Guide-Robot

Team: Jesse Rosart-Brodnitz and Shanley Mullen

The purpose of this project was to create a robot that could generate a floorplan of a building. This information is saved so when a user wants to go to a specific room the robot will lead the user there. This uses Odometery based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to track the robot's current position while scanning the environment around it. Points from the latest scan are offset by the current position. These are mapped by room so the robot will take the user to that destination. This started as the MXET 300 Final project but lead to entering the robot in the SICK TiM $10K competition, and the Texas A&M Engineering Showcase
